Page 1,"Lookieloo Earning Money from your Recs - Pilot Program Sign up here: https://www.lookielooapp.com/earn If you love finding great places and love sharing recs with friends, this is for you! Lookieloo is a platform for passionate explorers to share and discover great recs. It‚Äôs all from the community, and there are no ads. All the crowdsourced recs on Lookieloo will be free forever, but coming soon I‚Äôll be launching a paid plan generator. You‚Äôll be able to create a plan for an afternoon, or an entire week long trip from the best recs from real people who share your interests. I started Lookieloo because I wanted to build a travel community like no other. If I‚Äôm selling a product on top of free crowdsourced recs, I want to reward the people who add the recs that make it possible. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm creating this pilot program for earning money from your recs. How it works 1) Add your recs to Lookieloo! 2) In cities where I have at least 50 recs users can purchase custom generated plans from the crowdsourced recs. 3) Anytime your rec is included in a paid plan, you‚Äôll get a payout. 4) Users can generate a plan from all the recs on Lookieloo, or they can choose to generate a plan from your profile. The algorithm will then strongly prefer your recs over anyone else‚Äôs. You‚Äôll make more money, and if people love your travel style it‚Äôs better for them too! Example breakdown You add 30 of your best recs for New York City. 1000 people buy a weekend trip plan for NYC each month. 15 recs are included in each weekend plan. Your recs are high quality and popular, so 5 out of 15 recs in each weekend plan are yours. 1000 plans * 5 of your recs = 5000 times your rec is included. At .10 cents each you‚Äôd make $500 that month. While there‚Äôs a lot of hard work on my end to get this out there initially and reach 1000 sales for the first time, I think the upside is MUCH larger than that. In NYC alone, there are 66 million visitors every year!",365
Page 2,"The earlier you get started adding recs, the more likely your recs are to be included! If you‚Äôre one of the first people to build a great reputation on the site, it could be freaking amazing! FAQ Can I add recs for anywhere in the world? I‚Äôm focusing on launching a few major cities first, but technically yes. In fact, the earlier you add recs to a city and get upvotes, the better it will be for earnings long term! The cities I‚Äôm focusing on launching first are: New York, London, Lisbon, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Cape Town. The best bet is to start with adding recs to cities that I‚Äôm focusing on, and then expanding to other places. What kinds of recs should I add? The idea is to add whatever restaurants, places, activities, or experiences you‚Äôve enjoyed doing. Whatever you would share with a friend if they asked for recs! I‚Äôm also planning on adding events soon. So if you want to add a super secret dance party in the woods happening this weekend, AMAZING! On that note, I‚Äôm also going to be adding another type of rec: Secret recs ü§´ Secret recs limit how often the recs are shared, and only allow sharing with users who have a good reputation and/or have specific interests. For instance, you might not want to share that secret dance party with everyone! How many recs do I have to add? The minimum for earning at this stage is 10 recs. But the more you add, the more opportunity to earn. In the future, there may be more requirements. How much time does it take to add a rec? On average, about 3-5 minutes. Steps: 1) Write basically a tweet about why you loved a place. Write it like you‚Äôre telling a friend. 2) If it has a physical location, use the Google search widget to pull in location and hours. 3) There‚Äôll be options for including the budget and the best time to go soon! How will the recs be selected to be included? Many factors including: ‚óè What the user upvoted and saved on the site ‚óè What their profile says they‚Äôre into ‚óè Rec quality (How complete is the rec? Does it have a photo?) ‚óè Reputation of the user who submitted the rec ‚óè Weather!! ‚óè Route optimization",394
Page 3,"What if there‚Äôs already a rec for the place I want to add? It‚Äôs still great to have your rec on your profile for your friends and others to see. Plus, your rec could easily be chosen over the previously added rec if your style more closely matches the user creating the plan. I have plans to merge recs for the same place together over time so it doesn‚Äôt clutter the feed, but when they‚Äôre included in plans it‚Äôll be more about personality matching. How much will generating a plan cost? I‚Äôm not sure yet! I‚Äôm getting a lot of feedback on that right now. The rough estimate is $5 for a weekend trip, and $15 for a week. I‚Äôm also thinking of having a subscription for $19 a month that‚Äôd include 30 generated days each month. What do you think? The goal is to make this planner so good that you‚Äôll want to have it not just for travel, but at home too! Think effortless date nights, plans with friends, exploring a neighborhood on the other side of town etc. How much will each payout for a rec be? I haven‚Äôt modeled everything out yet, but 10 cents is a number that seems to make sense. Can you guarantee that I‚Äôll make money? No, but I‚Äôm working around the clock to make this site awesome and build an insanely amazing plan generator. I think it‚Äôs going to be an epic success from the initial response. I hope you‚Äôre excited by it and get involved‚Ä¶even though there‚Äôs always a chance that it‚Äôll flop üò≠ There‚Äôs also the chance that we‚Äôll build something amazing together! How will I get paid? Whenever you have $100 or more in your account, you can initiate a payout. It‚Äôll be processed with Stripe, the industry standard in payment processing, and can go directly to your bank account! Can anyone join the pilot program? Most people joining the program are people I know, friends of friends, or belong to a community I‚Äôm in. So if you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably gotten this doc from someone cool, who also thinks you‚Äôre cool‚Ä¶so you‚Äôre prob good to go! In the future, it‚Äôll be an application process. Will I be able to share my recs with my friends for free? Yes! Any rec that you add can be viewed for free, and you can send your profile link to friends where they can view all your recs together, organized by city. They‚Äôll have to pay to generate a plan though! How do I start? Sign up at this link: https://www.lookielooapp.com/earn Let‚Äôs make something amazing together! -Nicole",441
